Small ETL App

This Application's purpose is to get data from one SQL Server DB,
transform it and load it in a second SQL Server DB (our "DW"). Both DB's are in a Windows local server.
I know the SQL queries in order to fetch, transform and load the data can get really complicated,
but for the purpose of this example I will be using really simple SQL statements and also consider there is no
store procedure I could call from the server that could do the ETL for me.
